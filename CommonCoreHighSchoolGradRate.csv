These data are currently under review by ED and, upon completion of the data quality review, these tables will be updated to include any accepted revisions for MississippiÍs data.",,,,,,,,,"NOTE: The 4-year ACGR is the number of students who graduate in 4 years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the adjusted cohort for the graduating class. From the beginning of 9th grade (or the earliest high school grade), students who are entering that grade for the first time form a cohort that is ñadjustedî by adding any students who subsequently transfer into the cohort and subtracting any students who subsequently transfer out, emigrate to another country, or die. To protect the confidentiality of individual student data, ACGRs are shown at varying levels of precision depending on the size of the cohort population for each category cell. There are some differences in how states implemented the requirements for the ACGR, leading to the potential for differences across states in how the rates are calculated.  This is particularly applicable to the population of children with disabilities. Black includes African American, Hispanic includes Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander includes Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and American Indian includes Alaska Native. Race categories exclude Hispanic origin unless specified.",,,,,,,,,"SOURCE: EDFacts Data Groups 695 and 696, School year 2014_15; September 15, 2016.",,,,,,,,,
