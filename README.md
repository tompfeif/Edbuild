# Public School Analysis

## Shiny App
In order to analyze the public school funding within the US, several methods will be applied, but first a simple Shiny App will be utilized. Since the app will be relatively small, it can be stored and organized in a single file.

## QGIS and Tableau
To visualize school district data graphically, QGIS will be used to create and assemble mappings. Starting with one state or city will be best. Washington D.C. will be the starting point.

## D3.js
To improve the attractiveness of the visualizations and customize them, D3 will be used.
